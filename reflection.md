- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inheritance simplifies my programing, it allows me to accomplish the same thing with fewer lines of code and avoid any redundant programs.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was getting started early and testing regualarly to find the logical bugs in my code. What did not work was trying to avoid runtime exceptions. At first I tried to code without any, but then when I was testing I kept running into issues. Adivce for someone else would be to start small, get the simple part of the program working before moving onto more complicated aspects.
